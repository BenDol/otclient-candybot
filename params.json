{"name":"CandyBot","tagline":"Bot module for OTClient based off https://github.com/kilouco/otclient_bot (with permissions) the bots focus is usability, extendability and stability!","body":"CandyBot is an OTClient bot module that helps with Tibia game-play automation. CandyBot is designed to focus on efficiency, stability and safety (from bot-detection). It accomplishes these qualities using, modular style framework, thorough testing, and secure/safe 'game' functions + time delay randomization when logged into Cipsoft Servers.\r\n\r\n### The Purpose\r\nCandyBot is designed to fill the 'bot' gap for OTClient. Botting is a big part of OpenTibia, many people have demanded this functionality for OTClient so people that want to just have fun in OpenTibia servers can do so.\r\n\r\nThis module can be blocked if you are using OTClient to design a game type that should not allow 'botting'. So this is by no means forcing game developers into a bad place where players will abuse the bot, BOT_PROTECTION = TRUE!\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install CandyBot all you need to do is copy the root directory `otclient-candybot` into the [otclient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient) `/mods` directory and start otclient. If you don't have `otclient-candybot` directory you need to pull this repository (I haven't tagged any releases yet because it's too early in development).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Ben Dol (@BenDol)\r\n* Alexandre do Amaral Severino (@kilouco)\r\n\r\n[Contributors](https://github.com/BeniS/otclient-candybot/graphs/contributors)\r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n![Screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/49948294/otclient/candybot_support.png)\r\n![Screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/49948294/otclient/candybot_afk.png)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLicensed under MIT, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/BenDol/otclient-candybot/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you are interested in contributing to the CandyBot module, feel free to create pull requests.
